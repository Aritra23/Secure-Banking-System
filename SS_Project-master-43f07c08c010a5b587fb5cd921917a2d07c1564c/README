General rules:
0. Always work on a Issue (Let's try to be little professional :P). Create one if not created. 
1. Create your own branch for the issue. Branch Name (Issue-XXXX)
2. Write a issue number in the commit message. (Easy to track)
3. Create a merge request for the push which needs to be merge on master.
4. Let's not merge the commit without any review (This least will avoid overflow issue)

PS: Need help to write a script which upload code on vLab sever.
